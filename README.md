## Scripts

### How to execute

Just copy and paste the script file path to your console, like this:

```sh
./scripts/<script name here>.sh
```

If it doesn't work, it's probably because of the permissions, so run:

```sh
chmod 777 ./scripts/<script name here>.sh
```

### Scripts list

```
dev
	Starts the project on local environment
```
